# 📒 Command-Line Contact Book Application

A simple command-line contact book built in Python as part of **Month 1 - Python Fundamentals** internship task. This project demonstrates essential programming concepts including variables, loops, conditionals, file handling, and user input/output.

## 📚 Project Description

This application allows users to:
- Add a new contact (name, phone number, email)
- View all saved contacts
- Search for a contact by name

Contact information is stored in a plain text file for persistence, making it easy to manage and update using basic Python file operations.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- ✅ Understand Python syntax (variables, data types, operators)
- ✅ Use conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`) to control program logic
- ✅ Apply loops (`for`, `while`) effectively
- ✅ Handle user input and output
- ✅ Read from and write to text files
